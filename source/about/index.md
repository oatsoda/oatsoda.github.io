I've worked in software development for 20 years mainly for small, independent companies in the United Kingdom. My recent work has been in a .NET and Azure stack with, more specifically, Blazor WebAssembly and React front ends; with a distributed monolith architecture.

I have a passion for leaner agile approaches, TDD and Continuous Deployment.
